# STUDENT-SCORESHEET
In this code I have designed a Java application that collects full student performance data and generates a formatted report. The code incorporates java basics, control statements and arrays.

The program collects school and student details, stores marks for multiple subjects, calculates totals and averages, assigns grades based on performance, and finally prints a structured report card with subject-wise and overall statistics.
